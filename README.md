# CHORD_Sensitivity
Repo to compute sensitivity of CHORD to Radio Recombination Lines.


Input/Output Goals:
* get_sensitivity: Full sky sensitivity plots as a function of number of lines, channel resolution, angular smoothing
* snr_siggma: Get detection SNR from an input Siggma fits file
* optimize_survey: search parameter space for optimal settings based on sky location, velocity resolution, angular resolution, number of lines, observing days.
